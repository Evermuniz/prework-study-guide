## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students to use through the course. It was built to help me organize my notes and use as reference. This will help keep my notes centralized while applying the knowledge I'm learning. Throughtout the process I learned basics in HTML, Git, CSS, JavaScript, and CLI.
